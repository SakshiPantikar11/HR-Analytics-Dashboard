**📊HR Analytics Dashboard – Turning HR Data into Actionable Insights!**

I'm excited to share one of my recent projects: an interactive HR Analysis Dashboard built using Power BI. This project aimed to explore and analyze employee data to help HR teams make data-informed decisions around retention, satisfaction, and workforce planning.

**🛠️ Project Overview:**

In this project, we analyzed a comprehensive HR dataset to identify patterns in employee attrition, job satisfaction, demographics, and education backgrounds. The goal was to build a dashboard that not only visualizes key KPIs but also supports strategic decision-making in HR.

**🔍 Key Highlights:** 

✔️ Total Employees, Attrition Count & Rate

✔️Age-wise & Gender-wise Employee Distribution

✔️Department and Education Field-wise Attrition

✔️Job Role vs. Job Satisfaction Matrix

✔️ Age Group-wise Attrition Rate by Gender

✔️ Average Age of Employees and Active Workforce Stats


**💡 My Role & Tools Used:**

Built visual reports & charts using Power BI

Applied DAX functions for dynamic metrics

Focused on UX to ensure the dashboard is easy to explore and understand

This dashboard is a powerful example of how data analytics can uncover workforce trends and support HR in making smarter, people-first decisions.
